          <p class="heading-medium">Proportion of people in work has generally increased since 2012</p>
          <p>The lowest employment rate for people was 65.6% in 1983, during the economic downturn of the early 1980s. The employment rates for people, men and women have been generally increasing since early 2012. For the latest time period, April to June 2018, the employment rate for people was 75.6%, up from 75.1% for a year earlier.</p>

            </i>
            <p>Employment measures the number of people aged from 16 to 64 years in paid work. It differs from the number of jobs because some people have more than one job.</p>
          </div>

          <p class="list-heading">For April to June 2018:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>75.6% of people aged from 16 to 64 years were in work, up from 75.1% for a year earlier</li>
            <li>80.1% of men aged from 16 to 64 years were in work; the employment rate for men has not been higher since February to April 1991</li>
            <li>71.0% of women aged from 16 to 64 years were in work, up from 70.5% for a year earlier</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The increase in the employment rate for women over the last few years has been partly due to ongoing changes to the State Pension age for women, resulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 years.</p>

          <p>For April to June 2018, there were 32.39 million people in work, 42,000 more than for January to March 2018 and 313,000 more than for a year earlier.</p>

          <p>The following figure shows that more than half of the annual increase in the number of people in employment (313,000) was due to more women in full-time employment (170,000), with the number of men in full-time employment increasing by 101,000 over the year.</p>

The industrial sector showing the largest annual fall in the number of people in employment on “zero hours contracts” was human health and social work (down 62,000).
