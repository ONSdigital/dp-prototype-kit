      <p>A bulletin gives headline numbers and commentary, alongside essential quality and methodology information.</p>
      <p>It should be released with new data, and clearly link to more detailed content for users who want more than an overview.</p>
      <p>Bulletins should focus on topics that we know users are interested in. If we know users are interested in a number of topics in a release, we can publish more than one bulletin in a "collection".</p>

      <h2 id="collections">Collections</h2>

          <h3 id="what-is-a-collection">What is a collection?</h3>
              <p>
              A collection always contains the following things:
              </p><ul>

              <li>at least one <strong>dataset</strong>
              <li>a <strong>summary (bulletin)</strong> page, explaining the most important things about the new data</li></ul>

              <p>Where there's a clear user need for more detail on a specific topic (gender pay gap, for example), a collection can contain more than one summary page.</p>
              <p>An<strong> overview</strong> page contains commentary on the top-level findings from a collection.</p>
              <p>Where more in-depth analysis is required, <strong>articles</strong> can be added to a collection.
              </p>

          <h3 id="what-is-an-overview-page">What is an overview page?</h3>
              <p><em>User research found that users like the term overview for this type of page. As "Overview" and "Summary" can be used interchangeably, we're doing more research to find out whether this could be confusing.<br></em>
              </p>
              <p>Where a collection contains more than one summary (bulletin), an overview page summarises the most important information from across all the summary pages.</p>
              <p>For example, the <strong>Crime collection</strong> may include summaries on Weapons, Fraud and Homicide.</p>
              <p>The <strong>Crime overview</strong> would comment on overall Crime trends in the latest data, and might briefly explain the main causes of any changes (linking to the summary pages for more detail).</p>

          <h3 id="what-is-an-article">What is an article?</h3>
              <p><em>We are running more research to understand whether the word "article" means anything to users in this context.</em></p>
              <p>An article is less structured than a summary, and allows for more detailed information on a subject. Typical articles might include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>deeper analysis of a topic that cannot fit in the summary template
                  <li>analysis of the latest data alongside other data sources
                  <li>more information about methodology or planned changes to a collection</li>
              </ul>
              <p>As with any content on our website, there should be a clear user need for everything we publish. The length and detail of an article should be relative to the interest of our users. We will measure this using analytics and through user research.</p>
              <p>An article should only be used when it is not possible to communicate all of the information users need in a summary page (because of the number of words required, or because the analysis crosses multiple summaries or collections, for example).</p>

      <h2 id="how-to-decide-whether-you-need-more-pages">How to decide whether you need more pages?</h2>
              <p>Digital publishing will help you determine whether more pages would add value. We will use search data and user research to understand what users need. We may run extra research, or suggest small-scale experiments we can run to validate the need for a new page.</p>
              <p>We will also consider:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>whether users might expect to find information about this topic anywhere else (on another page in this collection, or elsewhere on the ONS website, for example)
                  <li>how the user need relates to the time and effort required to create and publish extra content
                  <li>can we communicate this using anything that already exists
                  <li>does it need to be published on the day of release
                  <li>whether this content is best written as an article or a bulletin (summary)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Once the page has been published, we will continually monitor its use to understand whether there is a continuing user need for this content.</p>
