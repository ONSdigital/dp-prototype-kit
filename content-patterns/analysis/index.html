      <h1 id="Analysis">Analysis</h1>
      <h2 id="Writing your analysis">Writing your analysis</h2>

      <p>When writing stories about statistics, focus on the 'story'  –  what's interesting, noteworthy or important.</p>
      <p>Don't couch the story in caveats and warnings. Where there are warnings about the reliability of the data, say so as briefly as possible. Avoid repeating caveats throughout your stories.</p>

  <h2 id="lead-point">Lead point</h2>
      <p>  This should be the most important story about your new data. When thinking about importance, consider:
      </p><ul>

      <li>what is the most interesting thing about the new data?
      <li>is that something that most users will find interesting?
      <li>is it statistically significant?
      <li>could anything about this point be misleading? </li></ul>

      <p>
      The lead point consists of a headline, a subtitle, and can include a visual (a chart, for example):
      </p>
      <p><strong>A headline</strong></p>
          <p>This should be less than 90 characters, summarise the most important story in your summary, and accurately describe any accompanying visuals or text.</p>
          <p><strong>Subtitle</strong></p>
          <p>Describe the statistical measure, geographic coverage, and time period as briefly as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Visual</strong></p>
          <p>This will typically be a chart, and should back up the message in the headline. A subtitle should explain the geography and time period.</p>
          <p>Where a chart could be misleading, or isn't appropriate, consider using a quote instead. The quote should be 50 to 60 words, and clearly attributed to an ONS employee, with their job title.</p>
          <p>Remember that you can add a quote alongside your lead point (see <span style="text-decoration:underline;">supporting information</span>) , which can be useful if you need to add nuance.</p>

  <h2 id="supporting-information">Supporting information</h2>
      <p>Alongside the lead point, supporting information can add nuance, or extra detail about the lead point. Supporting information can take the form of a quote or bullet points.</p>
      <p><strong>A quote</strong></p>
      <p>This is particularly useful where the lead point is complex, or requires further explanation.</p>
      <p>The quote can be 50 to 60 words long, and should be attributed to an ONS employee and their job title. </p>
      <p>The quote should not contradict the headline or visual from your lead point.</p>
      <p><strong>Bullet points</strong></p>
      <p>Where there are three or four short points to make which give more information about the summary.</p>

  <h2 id="main-points">Main points</h2>
    <p>  A main point is trend or finding from the data which is worth reporting. It
    should answer a question the user might have about your statistics.</p>
    <p>Main findings consist of a title and commentary. Add visuals, such as charts,
    tables, or interactives to backup each point. Use the warning pattern to draw
    attention to essential limitations or uncertainty which might affect the way
    people interpret a statistics.</p>
    <p>Aim for 5 or 6 main points on a page, adding up to no more than 800 words. If
    you know that users want to know more, consider adding more pages to your
    release.</p>
    <p>Communicating clearly with a small number of words can be difficult and time
    consuming, but we know it's what our users want. The content design team can
    help if you're finding anything difficult.</p>

    <p><h3>Title</h3></p>
        <p>
        Describe the finding as clearly as you can in the shortest number of words. When
        people read web pages, their eyes scan shapes and headings first, trying to find
        which bits of the page are going to be most useful to them. Even at a glance,
        titles should say something meaningful, and give a clear idea what the following
        commentary is about.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
          <p>
            <div class="content-box">
              <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
              <h4>Police recorded rises in knife and gun crime, mainly in large cities</h4>
            </div>
             <p>
        Be clear if there's any uncertainty in the point you're making, or you need to
        add context, but keep it simple. Complex terms or awkward phrasing reduced
        people's ability to understand and retain information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="content-box">
            <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
            <h4>Crime Survey shows long-term drop in violent crime but little change in
            recent years</h4>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
        If you can't say it simply, consider whether it should be a main point – can you
        highlight something more useful?
        </p>
        <p>
        The title should be less than 20 words (about 90 characters), to avoid running
        over two lines on a desktop.
        </p>
        <p>

    <h3>Commentary</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
        Use text, charts and/or tables to give more detail and context to your title.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your text should be in concise, plain English and written with the user in mind.
        Consider what is the most important information that supports your title.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you're not sure something is going to be useful or interesting, don't include
        it. Users can still find the data in datasets and further detail can be explored
        in an accompanying article.<br>
        <br>
        The first paragraph of each section must contain the most important fact. Use
        further paragraphs and figures to add more detail and context to broaden the
        user's understanding.
        </p>
        <p>

      <h3>Alerts</h3>
          <p>Alerts are designed to grab the user's attention. They can be inserted anywhere
          in your commentary to bring attention to very important information.</p>
              <table>
                <tr>
                 <td><strong>Do</strong>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                 <td>Use alerts to highlight essential limitations of the data
                 </td>
                 <td>Use too many warnings – it disrupts the reading experience and makes it
              difficult to understand the content
                 </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                 <td>Add context to help users avoid misinterpreting the data
                 </td>

                 </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                 <td>Make your alerts short, and clear
                 </td>
                 <td>Use complicated language – when text is hard to understand, people retain
              less information
                 </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                 </td>
                 <td>Lead with the alert – write your finding first, then add context. Testing
              has shown that users find it confusing when we write warnings before commentary.

    </div>
</div>
    <h2 id="charts-and-interactives">Charts and interactives</h2>
        <p>
        Use charts to deliver a clear message visually. If a chart doesn't tell its own
        "story", or doesn't fit with the narrative of the point you're writing, consider
        whether it's really needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        Use interactive charts and maps sparingly when they can bring an extra dimension
        to your data.
        </p>
        <p>
        Contact the ONS Data Visualisation Centre (datavis@ons.gov.uk) for advice and
        guidance on interactive charts.
        </p>

    <p><h3>Chart titles and subtitles</h3></p>
        <p>
        Charts should have a main title and a statistical subtitle, be concise and in
        sentence case.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main title should be descriptive, and tell the trend of the data or
        highlight the main story. Try to limit the number of words to no more than 10.
        This should make the description easier to read and avoid the text wrapping onto
        several lines, especially on mobile devices. If you need to add context or
        detail to the chart, use <a
        href="https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/titles-and-text/#annotation-and-footnotes">annotations</a>
        or support with your analysis.
        </p>
            <div class="content-box">
              <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
              <h4>Figure 1: Highest overall employment rate since 1971</h4>
            </div>
          <p>
        The statistical subtitle should be as short as possible and must include the:
        </p><ul>
          <li>statistical measure
          <li>geographic coverage
          <li>time period</li></ul>
                <div class="content-box">
                  <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
                  <h4>UK employment rates (aged 16 to 64 years), seasonally adjusted, 1971 to 2018</h4>
                </div>
        <p>
        When writing your chart title and analysis, take care to:
        </p><ul>
          <li>avoid repeating section headings
          <li>avoid repeating what you have written about in your analysis
          <li>add further context and explanation of the chart's message in your main
          text</li></ul>
        <p>

    <h3>Sources</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
        Figures and tables must provide a source, in the following format:
        </p>
        <p>[ORGANISATION], [PUBLICATION OR SOURCE OF DATA]</p>
            <div class="content-box">
              <h3 class="heading-medium">For example</h3>
              <h4>Office for National Statistics, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings</h4>
            </div>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
        Avoid chart footnotes. If extra information is needed:
        </p><ul>
        <li>annotate the chart
        <li>include the information in the commentary accompanying the chart</li></ul>
        <p>

<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
    <p>
    Tables can capture a great deal of data but often aren't the clearest or most
    transparent way of presenting the statistics or telling the story – a chart is
    usually clearer, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
    Show only the data you need to evidence the point you're making. If a user wants
    all of the data, they can download it. Only use tables in your bulletin if there
    is a strong justification for doing so.
    </p>
