          <div id="main-points" class="content-margin">
            <h2>1. Main points</h2>

              <p>Overall levels of crime showed falls in recent decades, but have remained broadly stable in recent years. While in the last year there has been no change in overall levels of crime, this hides variation seen in individual crime types. The latest figures show a mixed picture, with continued rises in some types of theft, “bank and credit account fraud”, and falls in “computer viruses”. There were also increases in some of the less frequently occurring but higher-harm types of violence, including offences involving a knife or sharp instrument.</p>

              <p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) indicated a continuing rise in fraud with the latest estimates showing a 15% increase, driven by a 17% rise in “bank and credit account fraud”.</p>

              <p>All other main crime types measured by the CSEW showed no change, including lower-harm violent offences (for example, violence without injury and assault with minor injury). However, police recorded crime gives more insight into the lower-volume but higher-harm violence that the survey either does not cover or does not capture well. These data show:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>a 5% decrease in the number of homicides following a period of increases over the last four years</li>
                <li>a 4% increase in the number of police recorded offences involving firearms</li>
                <li>a 7% increase<sup>1</sup> in the number of police recorded offences involving a knife or sharp instrument</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Many of these lower-volume, higher-harm types of violence tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas such as London, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. </p>

              <p>While the total number of offences involving a knife or sharp instrument increased in England and Wales, the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased by 14%. This decrease was mainly driven by falls in London. There is a mixed picture in the total number of offences involving knives or sharp instruments across different police force areas, with the Metropolitan Police recording little change in the last year.</p>

              <p>Although the latest estimate of theft offences measured by the CSEW showed no change in the last year, there was an 11% increase when compared with the year ending March 2017. While the CSEW provides the better indication of overall trends in theft offences, police recorded crime data can help identify short-term changes in individual offences that are thought to be well-reported and accurately recorded by the police. In the latest year, these data show:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>a 3% increase in vehicle offences, which includes a 7% rise in “theft or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle”</li>
                <li>an 11% increase in robbery</li>
                <li>a 4% decrease in burglary</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This bulletin reports on two main sources of crime data: the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) and police recorded crime. For further information on these sources, see  <a href="#measuring-the-data">Measuring the data</a> and <a href="#strengths-and-limitations">Strengths and limitations</a>. Further detail on how crime statistics are collected and analysed is available in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>

              <h3>Statistician's comment</h3>
                <p>Commenting on today’s figures, Joe Traynor from the Office for National Statistics Centre for Crime and Justice said:</p>

                <p>“In the last year there has been no change in overall levels of crime. However, this hides variations in different types of crime, in particular continued rises in bank and credit account fraud and falls in computer viruses.</p>
                <p>“And while overall levels of violence have remained steady, the number of offences involving a knife has continued to increase across England and Wales. However, the number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased, driven by falls in London. There is a mixed picture in the total number of knife crime offences across police forces with the Metropolitan Police recording little change in the last year.”</p>

              <h4>Notes for main points:</h4>
                <ol>
                  <li>Excludes Greater Manchester Police (GMP) because of a technical issue that resulted in previous undercounting of crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument. GMP have now changed their methodology and data from December 2017 onwards have been revised. Due to these changes data for GMP are not comparable over this time.</li>

                              <li>Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) data relate to adults aged 16 years and over.</li>
                              <li>New victimisation questions on fraud and computer misuse were added to the CSEW from October 2015. The questions were asked of half the survey sample initially and have been asked of the full sample since October 2017. These offences need to be excluded when looking at changes over the long term to make figures comparable.</li>

                <p>According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), adults aged 16 years and over experienced 11.1 million offences (including fraud and computer misuse offences). Despite some apparent fluctuation over the last two years, there have been no statistically significant changes in total CSEW-recorded crime during this period. The trend has therefore been flat. However, it is important to look at individual crime types as the relatively stable overall picture hides variation both within and across crime types. </p>

                <p>In contrast, the number of crimes recorded by the police increased by 7% in the last year (to 6.0 million offences). Over the longer term, the trend in the number of police recorded crimes has been similar to that measured by the CSEW. However, the rises seen over recent years indicate a different trend to the CSEW and reflect a combination of factors, including continuing improvements to recording processes and practices, more victims reporting crime, and genuine increases in some types of crime. </p>

                      Improvements to recording processes and practices by the police have made substantial contributions to rises in recorded crime over the last five years. This effect has been more pronounced for some crime types, and for many types of offence, these figures do not provide reliable trends in crime.

This latest rise is smaller than seen a year ago but continues the year-on-year increase in these offences since the year ending March 2014.

             <p>In the latest year, the offence “assault with injury and assault with intent to cause serious harm” accounted for almost half of all offences involving a knife or sharp instrument (45% or 19,994 offences). Robberies accounted for a further 43% (18,987 offences).</p>

             <p>Knife or sharp instrument offences are concentrated in metropolitan areas. 32% of all offences recorded by the police involving a knife or sharp instrument happened in London. The capital showed the highest rate of 169 offences per 100,000 population, compared with an England and Wales average of 80 offences per 100,000 population.</p>

            <p> Other sources of data can help to provide insight into offences involving a knife or sharp instrument.

          <p>Recorded offences involving firearms increased by 4% to 6,734 in the year ending June 2019 compared with the previous year (6,445 offences), including large increases in unidentified firearms<sup>1</sup> and other firearms<sup>2</sup> (18% and 33% respectively). These increases were balanced by decreases seen in offences involving handguns and rifles.</p>
          <p>We are aware of improvements in recording practices by the police to better identify the involvement of a firearm that will have contributed to this latest rise. However, the scale of the effect is unclear. These improvements have impacted on offences identified as involving “other firearms” (which include weapons such as stun guns, CS gas and pepper spray).</p>

          <p>The police recorded 681 homicides in the year ending June 2019, a 5% fall (from 719) compared with the previous year. This includes a decrease recorded by the Metropolitan Police in the latest year following a notably high number recorded in the previous year. This fall continues the decrease reported last quarter, when the number of homicides fell for the first time since the year ending March 2014. The rate of homicide in the population remains very low, at 12 homicides per 1 million people.</p>
          <p>The number of homicides where a knife or sharp instrument was involved decreased by 14% in the year ending June 2019 (to 248 offences). Of all recorded homicides in the latest year, 39% involved a knife or sharp instrument, the same proportion as the previous year. The recent reduction in such offences was driven by falls seen in London, where the Metropolitan Police recorded a 32% reduction to 63 homicides involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year ending June 2019.</p>

          <p>Police recorded crime data can give reliable indications of trends in some types of theft. For example, domestic burglary and theft of a vehicle are less likely to be affected by the impact of recording improvements, as they are relatively well-reported to (and subsequently recorded by) the police.</p>
          <p>Figures for the year ending June 2019 show that the number of burglary offences recorded by the police decreased by 4% (to 417,416 offences). This contrasts with rises in police recorded burglary offences seen in the years ending March 2016 and March 2017.</p>
          <p>Police recorded vehicle offences increased by 3% (to 469,915), continuing the rising trend seen over the last three years. However, the size of the increase has reduced over the last year. The latest rise compares with an increase of 7% in the year ending June 2018. This is mainly because of smaller increases seen in both “theft or unauthorised taking of a vehicle” (7%, to 115,777 offences) and “theft from a vehicle” (2%, to 284,225 offences).</p>
          <p>Rises in police recorded robbery offences were evident for the fourth consecutive year, with an increase of 11% (to 88,177 offences) in the year ending June 2019, compared with the previous year. While recording improvements are likely to have contributed to the rise, some of the increase is likely to reflect a real change. Robbery is a violent offence that is more likely to be reported by the victim and recorded by the police than some other theft offences.</p>

      <h2>9. Criminal damage and arson</h2>

          <p>The overall volume of criminal damage in the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) has not changed over the last year (1.1 million offences). Following a period of decreases over the last 10 years, the subcategory “criminal damage to a vehicle” also shows no change. However, it is too early to say whether this is evidence of a change to the longer-term pattern. The latest figure (741,000 offences) is at a similar level to that seen in the year ending June 2018 and is less than half the volume it was in the year ending December 1995 (1.8 million offences).</p>
          <p>In comparison with the findings from the CSEW, police recorded crime data show a 3% decrease in criminal damage and arson (to 568,131 offences) and an 8% fall in criminal damage to a vehicle. The differences in criminal damage to a vehicle between the CSEW and police recorded crime could be partly explained by a relatively low reporting rate for this type of offence.</p>

                      </div>

            <p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the best measure of fraud offences directly experienced by individuals in England and Wales. Findings for the year ending June 2019 estimated that the number of fraud incidents increased by 15% (to 3.9 million offences) from the previous year. The increase was driven mainly by a 17% increase in “bank and credit account fraud” (to 2.7 million offences).</p>

            <p>  Police recorded fraud incorporates fraud offences collated by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) from Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been a victim). Latest figures showed a 16% increase in the total number of fraud offences referred to the NFIB<sup>1</sup>, in the year ending June 2019 (740,845 offences), compared with the previous year (638,069 offences).</p>

            <p>All three fraud reporting bodies, Action Fraud, Cifas and UK Finance, reported increases in the latest year. Action Fraud reported a 13% rise (to 322,689 offences), Cifas reported a 20% rise (to 328,953 offences) and UK Finance reported a 12% rise (to 89,203 offences). These increases need to be interpreted in the context of differences in coverage and fraud types captured by each reporting body. In addition, due to a temporary problem, the figures should be treated as provisional.</p>

            <p>Fraud offences referred to the authorities make up a relatively small proportion of the overall volume of fraud. The CSEW captures a large volume of lower-harm cases that are less likely to have been reported to the authorities, while incidents of fraud referred to the NFIB will include reports from businesses and other organisations, which are not generally included in the CSEW and tend to mostly be focused on the more serious cases.</p>

            <p>Additional fraud data collected by UK Finance<sup>2</sup> provide a broader range of bank account and plastic card frauds than those referred for police investigation to the NFIB. In the latest year, UK Finance reported 2.8 million cases of fraud offences involving UK-issued payment cards, remote banking and cheques via the Cards Management Information System (CAMIS). This is an increase of 31% from the previous year, driven largely by a rise in plastic card fraud and particularly remote purchase fraud.</p>

        <h4>Notes for fraud:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li> In October 2018, Action Fraud launched a new fraud and cybercrime reporting service. The transition to the new system is not yet complete, and there has been a pause in the data feed from Cifas to the NFIB. Although fraud continues to be recorded by Cifas, cases from December 2018 have not yet been “referred” to the NFIB. Therefore, the Cifas figures and any NFIB totals presented in this bulletin and accompanying data tables are based on provisional data provided by Cifas. Once the issue has been resolved, the NFIB will hold a full copy of the data, allowing Cifas figures to be treated as confirmed and recognised as “referred” to the NFIB.<br><br>

               The UK Finance figures and NFIB totals presented in this bulletin and accompanying data tables are supplemented by provisional data provided by UK Finance. This is as a result of a small percentage of the records supplied by UK Finance having not been successfully processed by NFIB systems. The NFIB is working to ensure that all referrals from UK Finance are successfully processed, at which point the need for provisional data will be removed.</li>
              <li>The UK Finance CAMIS system contains cases where it has been judged that there is no evidential value, and it includes many cases not referred to the NFIB given the limited scope for investigation. CAMIS data also include those cases referred by UK Finance to the NFIB.</li>

    <div id="computer-misuse">
      <h2>11. Computer misuse</h2>

          <p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) provides the better indication of the volume of computer misuse offences as it captures incidents that go unreported to the police. This can be seen by the large difference in the volume of computer misuse offences between the two sources: 977,000 offences were estimated by the CSEW in the year ending June 2019, compared with 20,329 offences referred to the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) by Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre). In addition, the two sources have different coverage, which means it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between them.</p>

          <p>In the year ending June 2019, the CSEW estimated that the volume of computer misuse offences did not change from the previous year. However, variations existed within the subcategories of “computer viruses” and “unauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)”<sup>1</sup>. While “computer viruses” fell by 27% in the last year (to 442,000 offences), incidents involving “unauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)” did not change significantly (535,000 offences).</p>

          <p>All “computer misuse crime” referred to the NFIB by Action Fraud fell by 7% in the year ending June 2019, to 20,329 offences. This decrease follows consecutive rises in the previous two years, and the latest estimate remains 54% higher than in the year ending March 2016. The recent fall in computer misuse recorded by Action Fraud will, to some extent, have been affected by improvements to both internal case review processes and their online reporting tool. These changes took place in October 2018, resulting in some computer misuse offences now being more accurately classified as fraud offences.</p>

          <p>For the latest headline figures relating to computer misuse and for more detailed figures including timeseries see <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">Appendix tables</a> and <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesappendixtables">Other related tables</a>.</p>

        <h4>Notes for computer misuse:</h4>
              <ol>
                <li>A small change has been implemented to the coding of subcategories of “Unauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)” and “Other fraud”. As a result, these latest estimates will show small differences compared with publications prior to April 2019. Within the coding of offences relating to “Unauthorised access to personal information (including hacking)”, there were found to be a small number of cases with no evidence that a victim’s personal information had been stolen online. Looking in more detail at these, in some cases respondents report receiving new bank cards that they had not ordered or new accounts in their name that they had not set up. Such cases are now coded as “application frauds” within the “other fraud” category.</li>

    <h2>13. Glossary</h2>

            <h3>Fraud</h3>
            <p>Fraud involves a person dishonestly and deliberately deceiving a victim for personal gain of property or money, or causing loss or risk of loss to another. The majority of incidents fall under the legal definition of “Fraud by false representation” – where a person makes a representation that they know to be untrue or misleading (for example, banking and payment card frauds and dating scams). The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) estimates cover a broad range of fraud offences, including attempts, involving a loss and incidents not reported to the authorities.</p>

            <h3>Homicide</h3>
            <p>Homicide includes the offences of murder, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and infanticide.</p>

            <h3>Knife and sharp instrument offences</h3>
            <p>Knife and sharp instrument offences are any offence that is recorded by the police as involving a knife or sharp instrument when the weapon is present during the offence or the threat is believed to be real. The weapon does not necessarily have to be used. These data are based on a special collection covering selected offences.</p>

            <h3>Offences involving firearms</h3>
            <p>Offences involving firearms include those where a firearm is fired, used as a blunt instrument, or used as a threat. Firearms include shotguns; handguns; rifles; imitation weapons such as BB guns or soft air weapons; other weapons such as CS gas, pepper spray and stun guns; and unidentified weapons. They exclude conventional air weapons, such as air rifles.</p>

            <h3>Overall theft offences</h3>
            <p>Overall theft offences in the CSEW include all personal and household crime where items are stolen, including theft from the person; other theft of personal property; domestic burglary; vehicle-related theft; and bicycle theft.</p>

            <h3>Violent crime</h3>
            <p>Violent crime covers a range of offence types from minor assaults, such as pushing and shoving that result in no physical harm, to murder. This includes offences where the victim was intentionally stabbed, punched, kicked, pushed or jostled as well as offences where the victim was threatened with violence, regardless of injury.</p>

            <p>A full guide to crime types and definitions can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales#offence-types">User Guide to Crime Statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>

      <h2>14. Measuring the data</h2>
            <p>This page is part of our quarterly crime collection, which relies on two main sources of data.</p>

            <p><strong>Crime Survey of England and Wales</strong></br>
              The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a face-to-face victimisation survey that asks people resident in households in England and Wales about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview.</p>

            <p><strong>Police recorded crime</strong></br>
            Police recorded crime is the number of <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/695f6775-3e51-4dd4-911a-19575638384c/home-office-counting-rules-for-recorded-crime">notifiable crimes</a> reported to and recorded by the 44 police forces in England and Wales. For some types of crime, due to ongoing changes in police recording practices, an increase in the number of offences recorded by the police is unlikely to indicate a real rise in these types of crime. Police recorded crime data are not designated as <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/about-the-authority/uk-statistical-system/types-of-official-statistics/">National Statistics</a>. Details of concerns over the quality of these data are in the most recent UK Statistics Authority <a href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/statistics-on-crime-in-england-and-wales/">assessment report</a>. </p>

            <p>More information on both these sources can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>
            <p>More information on the methodology can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeinenglandandwalesqmi">Crime in England and Wales Quality and Methodology Information report</a>.</p>

    <div id="strengths-and-limitations">
      <h2>15. Strengths and limitations</h2>

            <h3>Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW)</h3>
            <p>The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a large nationally representative sample survey that has used a consistent methodology over time. The survey covers crimes not reported to the police, and it is not affected by changes in police recording practices; therefore, it is a reliable measure of long-term trends.</p>
            <p>The CSEW does not cover crimes against businesses and those not resident in households (for example, residents of institutions and visitors), and headline estimates exclude offences that are difficult to estimate robustly (such as sexual offences) or that have no victim who can be interviewed (for example, homicides and drug offences). In addition, the survey is subject to error associated with sampling and respondents recalling past events. A potential time lag between occurrence of the crime and survey data collection means that the survey is not a good measure of emerging trends.</p>


            <h3>Police recorded crime </h3>
            <p>Police recorded crime has wider offence coverage and population coverage than the CSEW. It is the primary source of local crime statistics, and it is a good measure of offences that are well-reported to and well-recorded by the police as well as lower-volume crimes (for example, homicide). In addition, the time lag between occurrence of crime and reporting results tends to be short, providing an indication of emerging trends.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, police recorded crime excludes offences that are not reported to, or not recorded by, the police and it does not include less serious offences dealt with by magistrates’ courts (for example, motoring offences). Trends can be influenced by changes in recording practices or police activity as well as public reporting of crime, making it difficult to make long-term comparisons. There are also concerns about the quality of recording and concerns that crime is not recorded consistently across police forces.</p>
