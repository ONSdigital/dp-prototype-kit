      <h2>3. Fraud</h2>
                  <!-- missing chart-->

          <p>The CSEW provides the best measure of fraud offences directly experienced by individuals in England and Wales. Findings for the year ending March 2019 estimated that the number of fraud incidents increased by 17% (to 3.8 million offences) from the previous year. The increase was driven mainly by a 15% increase in “bank and credit account fraud” (to 2.6 million offences).</p>

          <p>Police recorded fraud incorporates fraud offences collated by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) from Action Fraud (the public-facing national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre) and two industry bodies, Cifas and UK Finance (who report instances of fraud where their member organisations have been a victim). Latest figures showed a 9% rise in the total number of offences referred to the NFIB (to 693,418 offences) compared with the previous year.</p>

          <p>Some differences were apparent when looking at the separate reporting bodies. Action Fraud reported a 12% rise (to 311,083 offences), Cifas reported a 13% rise (to 313,175 offences), and UK Finance reported an 18% fall (to 69,160 offences). These need to be interpreted in the context of differences in coverage and fraud types captured by the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">individual fraud reporting bodies.</a></p>

                      <!-- Warning text -->
                    <div class="warning-text" style="padding: 0; margin-bottom: 24px;">

                        <span class="warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
                        Due to a temporary problem with NFIB systems, it is estimated that around 8,000 fraud offences referred by UK Finance have not yet been uploaded. The scale of the decrease compared with the previous year is likely to be substantially smaller than reported in these figures.
                    </strong>
                    </div>

          <p>Fraud offences referred to the authorities make up a relatively small proportion of the overall volume of fraud. The CSEW captures a large volume of lower-harm cases that are less likely to have been reported to the authorities, while incidents of fraud referred to the NFIB will include reports from businesses and other organisations, and tend to mostly be focused on the more serious cases. </p>

          <p>Additional fraud data collected by UK Finance via their CAMIS reporting database provide a broader range of bank account and plastic card frauds than those referred for police investigation to the NFIB. In the latest year, UK Finance reported 2.8 million cases of frauds involving UK-issued payment cards, remote banking and cheques via CAMIS. This is an increase of 39% from the previous year, driven largely by a rise in plastic card fraud, and particularly remote purchase fraud.</p>

    <h2>4. Computer misuse</h2>

          <p>The CSEW provides the better indication of the volume of computer misuse offences as it is able to capture some of the many incidents which go unreported. This can be seen by the large difference in volume of computer misuse offences reported by the CSEW (966,000 offences) and those referred to the NFIB by Action Fraud (21,321 offences). In addition, the two sources have different coverage which means it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between them.</p>

          <p>In the year ending March 2019, the CSEW estimated that computer misuse offences decreased by 21% from the previous year (to 966,000 offences; Table 6). This decrease was largely owing to a fall in “computer viruses” (down 38% to 444,000 offences).</p>

          <p>All “computer misuse crime” referred to the NFIB by Action Fraud increased by 1% in the latest year ending March 2019 (to 21,321 offences). This rise was less pronounced than seen previously, due in part to a notable decrease of 37% over the latest year in computer viruses (to 4,177 offences). The overall rise was driven by increases in “hacking – extortion” (up 303% to 4,150 offences) and “hacking – social media and email” (up 3% to 8,340 offences).</p>

          <div id="glossary">
            <h2>5. Glossary</h2>

                <h3>Action Fraud</h3>
                <p>Action Fraud is a public-facing national reporting centre that records incidents of fraud and internet crime directly from the public and other organisations.</p>

                <h3>Computer misuse</h3>
              <p>  Computer misuse crimes cover any unauthorised access to computer material, as set out in the Computer Misuse Act 1990, such as incidents where the victim’s computer or other internet-enabled device has been infected by a virus, as well as incidents where the respondent’s email or social media accounts had been hacked into by others.</p>

                <h3>Fraud</h3>
                <p>Fraud involves a person dishonestly and deliberately deceiving a victim for personal gain of property or money, or causing loss or risk of loss to another. The majority of incidents fall under the legal definition of “Fraud by false representation” – where a person makes a representation that they know to be untrue or misleading (e.g. banking and payment card frauds and dating scams).</p>

              <h3>  National Fraud Intelligence Bureau</h3>
                <p>The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) is a government-funded initiative run by the City of London Police.</p>

              <h3>  Remote purchase fraud</h3>
                <p>Remote purchase fraud refers to frauds where, in the vast majority of cases, card details have been fraudulently obtained through unsolicited emails or telephone calls or digital attacks, such as malware and data hacks, and then used to undertake fraudulent purchases over the internet, phone or by mail order.</p>


            <p>A comprehensive guide to crime types and definitions can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales#offence-types">User Guide to Crime Statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>

            <h2>6. Measuring this data</h2>
            <p>This page is part of our quarterly crime collection, which relies on two main sources of data.</p>

            <p><strong>Crime Survey of England and Wales</strong></br>
            The CSEW is a face-to-face victimisation survey, which asks people resident in households in England and Wales about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview.</p>

            <p><strong>Police recorded crime</strong></br>
            Police recorded crime is the number of <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/695f6775-3e51-4dd4-911a-19575638384c/home-office-counting-rules-for-recorded-crime">notifiable crimes</a> reported to and recorded by the 44 police forces in England and Wales. For some types of crime, due to ongoing changes in police recording practices, an increase in the number of offences recorded by the police is unlikely to indicate a real rise in these types of crime. Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>

            <p>More information on both these sources can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>

            <h3>Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW)</h3>
            <p>The CSEW is a large nationally representative sample survey that has used a consistent methodology over time. The survey covers crimes not reported to the police and is not affected by changes in police recording practice; therefore, it is a reliable measure of long-term trends. </p>
            <p>The CSEW does not cover crimes against businesses and those not resident in households (for example, residents of institutions and visitors), and headline estimates exclude offences that are difficult to estimate robustly (such as sexual offences) or that have no victim who can be interviewed (for example, homicides and drug offences). In addition, the survey is subject to error associated with sampling and respondents recalling past events. Potential time lag between occurrence of the crime and survey data collection means that the survey is not a good measure of emerging trends. </p>

            <h3>Police recorded crime </h3>
            <p>Police recorded crime has wider offence coverage and population coverage than the CSEW. It is the primary source of local crime statistics and is a good measure of offences that are well-reported to and well-recorded by the police, as well as lower volume crimes (for example, homicide). In addition, the time lag between occurrence of crime and reporting results tends to be short, providing an indication of emerging trends.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, police recorded crime excludes offences that are not reported to, or not recorded by, the police and does not include less serious offences dealt with by magistrates’ courts (for example, motoring offences). Trends can be influenced by changes in recording practices or police activity as well as public reporting of crime, making it difficult to make long-term comparisons. There are also concerns about the quality of recording – crimes may not be recorded consistently across police forces and so the true level of recorded crime may be understated.</p>
