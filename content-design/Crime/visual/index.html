          <!-- Section 2 - main points-->
          <div id="main-points" class="content-margin">
            <h2>1. Main points</h2>
            <p>Overall levels of crime showed falls in recent decades, but levels have remained broadly stable in recent years. While in the last year there has been no change in overall levels of crime, this hides variation seen in individual crime types. The latest figures show a mixed picture, with continued rises in some types of theft and fraud and falls in computer misuse. Consistent with the rising trend over recent years, there were increases in some of the less frequently occurring but higher-harm types of violence, including offences involving knives and sharp instruments.</p>

            <h3>Headline figures</h3>
              <p>Over recent quarters, estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) have indicated rises in theft. While the latest estimate showed no significant change in the last year, estimates of theft remain much lower than 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>Police recorded crime figures give a reliable indication of trends in some types of offence involving theft that are thought to be well-reported and accurately recorded by the police. In the latest year these data show:</p>

              <ul>
                <li class">a 2% increase in vehicle offences</li>
                <li>an 11% increase in robbery</li>
                <li>a 3% decrease in burglaries</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The CSEW shows that the level of lower-harm violent offences did not change. However, police recorded crime gives more insight into the lower-volume but higher-harm violence that the survey either does not cover or does not capture well. These data show:</p>

              <ul>
                <li class">an 8% increase in the number of offences involving knives or sharp instruments</li>
                <li>a 3% increase in the number of offences involving firearms</li>
                <li>a 4% decrease in the number of homicides</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Many of these lower-volume, higher-harm types of violence tend to be concentrated in metropolitan police force areas.</p>
              <p>The other changes seen in the main crime types measured by the CSEW were:</p>

              <ul>
                <li class">a 17% increase in fraud offences</li>
                <li>a 21% decrease in computer misuse</li>
              </ul>

            <div class="content-margin">
              <h3>Statistician's comment</h3>
                <p>Commenting on today’s figures, Mark Bangs from the Office for National Statistics Centre for Crime and Justice said:</p>
                <p>“The picture of crime is a complex one. Overall levels of crime have remained steady, but this is not the case for all types of crime. For example, overall levels of violence have remained steady but we have seen increases in violent crimes involving knives and sharp instruments. We have seen increases in fraud and overall theft, but decreases in burglary following recent rises.”</p>

    <h2>4. Glossary</h2>

            <h3>Fraud</h3>
            <p>Fraud involves a person dishonestly and deliberately deceiving a victim for personal gain of property or money, or causing loss or risk of loss to another. The majority of incidents fall under the legal definition of “Fraud by false representation” – where a person makes a representation that they know to be untrue or misleading (e.g. banking and payment card frauds and dating scams).</p>

            <h3>Homicide</h3>
            <p>  Homicide includes the offences of murder, manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and infanticide.</p>

            <h3>Knife and sharp instrument offences</h3>
            <p> An offence is recorded by the police as involving a knife or sharp instrument when the weapon is present during the offence or the threat is believed to be real. The weapon does not necessarily have to be used. These data are based on a special collection covering selected offences.</p>

            <h3>  Offences involving firearms</h3>
            <p>Offences involving a firearm include those where a firearm is fired, used as a blunt instrument, or used as a threat. Firearms include shotguns; handguns; rifles; imitation weapons such as BB guns or soft air weapons; other weapons such as CS gas, pepper spray and stun guns; and unidentified weapons. They exclude conventional air weapons, such as air rifles.</p>

            <h3>Overall theft offences</h3>
            <p>Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) theft offences include all personal and household crime where items are stolen, including theft from the person; other theft of personal property; domestic burglary; vehicle-related theft; and bicycle theft.</p>

            <h3>Violent crime</h3>
            <p>Covers a range of offence types from minor assaults, such as pushing and shoving that result in no physical harm, to murder. This includes offences where the victim was intentionally stabbed, punched, kicked, pushed or jostled, as well as offences where the victim was threatened with violence, regardless of injury.</p>

            <p>A comprehensive guide to crime types and definitions can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales#offence-types">User Guide to Crime Statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>

    <div id="measuring-this-data">
      <h2>5. Measuring this data</h2>
            <p>This page is part of our quarterly crime collection, which relies on two main sources of data.</p>

            <p><strong>Crime Survey of England and Wales</strong></br>
            The CSEW is a face-to-face victimisation survey, which asks people resident in households in England and Wales about their experiences of a selected range of offences in the 12 months prior to the interview.</p>

            <p><strong>Police recorded crime</strong></br>
            Police recorded crime is the number of <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/695f6775-3e51-4dd4-911a-19575638384c/home-office-counting-rules-for-recorded-crime">notifiable crimes</a> reported to and recorded by the 44 police forces in England and Wales. For some types of crime, due to ongoing changes in police recording practices, an increase in the number of offences recorded by the police is unlikely to indicate a real rise in these types of crime. Police recorded crime data are not designated as National Statistics.</p>

            <p>More information on both these sources can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/userguidetocrimestatisticsforenglandandwales">User guide to crime statistics for England and Wales</a>.</p>
            <p>More information on the methodology can be found in the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/methodologies/crimeinenglandandwalesqmi">Crime in England and Wales Quality and Methodology Information report</a>.</p>

    <div id="strengths-and-limitations">
      <h2>6. Strengths and limitations</h2>

            <h3>Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW)</h3>
            <p>The CSEW is a large nationally representative sample survey that has used a consistent methodology over time. The survey covers crimes not reported to the police and is not affected by changes in police recording practice; therefore, it is a reliable measure of long-term trends. </p>
            <p>The CSEW does not cover crimes against businesses and those not resident in households (for example, residents of institutions and visitors), and headline estimates exclude offences that are difficult to estimate robustly (such as sexual offences) or that have no victim who can be interviewed (for example, homicides and drug offences). In addition, the survey is subject to error associated with sampling and respondents recalling past events. Potential time lag between occurrence of the crime and survey data collection means that the survey is not a good measure of emerging trends. </p>

            <h3>Police recorded crime </h3>
            <p>Police recorded crime has wider offence coverage and population coverage than the CSEW. It is the primary source of local crime statistics and is a good measure of offences that are well-reported to and well-recorded by the police, as well as lower volume crimes (for example, homicide). In addition, the time lag between occurrence of crime and reporting results tends to be short, providing an indication of emerging trends.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, police recorded crime excludes offences that are not reported to, or not recorded by, the police and does not include less serious offences dealt with by magistrates’ courts (for example, motoring offences). Trends can be influenced by changes in recording practices or police activity as well as public reporting of crime, making it difficult to make long-term comparisons. There are also concerns about the quality of recording – crimes may not be recorded consistently across police forces and so the true level of recorded crime may be understated.</p>

            <p>Statistics based on police recorded crime data have been assessed against the Code of Practice for Statistics and found not to meet the required standard for designation as National Statistics. The full assessment report can be found on the <a class href="https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/statistics-on-crime-in-england-and-wales/">UK Statistics Authority website.</a></p>
